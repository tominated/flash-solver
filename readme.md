# Manual Flash Photography Calculator

I recently got myself a manual speedlight for my film cameras and couldn't
find a calculator online that worked for me. I could easily use a chart, but
thought it might be fun to build something myself instead.

This is super rough and I have no idea if the math is corrct. Once I have the
basic functionality down, I'll ensure everything is correct, and make sure
I expose useful, rounded values through the UI.
